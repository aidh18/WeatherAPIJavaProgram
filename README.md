# WeatherJavaProgram
# Overview
This program allows the user to input any city around the world to get information about the weather there. My purpose for writing this software was to further my knowledge of programming languages. This is my first program in Java, and I wanted to challenge myself with something I wasn't very comfortable with (APIs). 

# Development Environment
This was programmed in Java using the IntelliJ IDEA. This program uses the org.json library. 

# Future Work
I want to potentially add a system that allows the user to save weather information to a file.
